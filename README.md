scSlideShow
===========

A super compact method to make a responsive slideshow with dynamic controls and support for dynamically generated images that are cropped reasonably. We're not trying to do everything, just a timed fade, a couple controls, and support for cropping portrait, landscape or square images while centering them vertically and horizontally.

This should work extremely well with Bootstrap and BigCommerce.

Requirements
============

jQuery (Tested with 1.10)
